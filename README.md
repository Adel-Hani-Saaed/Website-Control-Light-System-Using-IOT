🌐💡 First Step in the FOTA Project: Building a Website to Control Lights Over The Air! 🚀🔌



I'm thrilled to kick off our FOTA (Flashing Over The Air) project, where we'll create a simple yet powerful website to control lights wirelessly using ESP8266 as a Wi-Fi module and an STM32F401CC microcontroller. Let's dive into the software architecture and the steps to build the website:

1- 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫:

  - The application layer will handle user interactions and communicate with the ESP8266 module and STM32F401CC to control the lights over the air.



2- 𝐇𝐀𝐋 (𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫):

  - Here, we'll interface with the hardware components, including LEDs and the ESP8266 module. This layer abstracts the hardware details, making it easier to develop and maintain.



3- 𝐌𝐂𝐀𝐋 (𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫):

  - This layer deals with microcontroller-specific functionalities, like configuring clocks (RCC), managing GPIOs, handling interrupts (NVIC), system tick (Systick), external interrupts (EXTI), and serial communication (USART).



Now, let's talk about building the website:

  - To make our project accessible and user-friendly, we'll create a web interface. Here's how we'll do it:



  1. 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: We'll use Freewha.com to obtain a domain and hosting. This will give us a unique web address and a place to store our website files.



  2. 𝐇𝐓𝐌𝐋 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐒𝐒: We'll design the website's user interface using HTML and CSS. This will provide an intuitive and visually appealing control panel for users.



  3. 𝐏𝐇𝐏: To add functionality, we'll use PHP. PHP will enable us to send commands from the website to our ESP8266 module and receive status updates.



  4. 𝐔𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬: We'll use FileZilla or a similar FTP (File Transfer Protocol) application to upload our website files to the hosting server. This will make the website accessible over the internet.



By combining these technologies, we'll create a seamless and secure interface for users to control lights remotely, ensuring an enhanced user experience.
